# Report for Initializing the Slotcraft Frontend Logic Library

This report details the execution of the plan to initialize the `slotcraft` frontend logic library project.

## 1. Plan Execution Summary

The project was initialized successfully according to the plan. The following steps were completed:

- **Project Initialization**: A `package.json` file was created and configured.
- **TypeScript Setup**: TypeScript was installed, and a `tsconfig.json` file was created with appropriate settings.
- **Vitest Setup**: Vitest was installed and configured for testing and coverage. The coverage requirement was set to 90%.
- **Directory Structure**: The `src` and `test` directories were created, along with placeholder files.
- **NPM Scripts**: The `package.json` file was updated with scripts for building, testing, and checking coverage.
- **GitHub Actions CI**: A CI workflow was created to automate testing on push and pull requests.

## 2. Challenges and Solutions

During the "NPM Script Configuration" step, the `npm run coverage` command failed with an error related to the coverage provider.

- **Problem**: The initial configuration used `c8` as the coverage provider, which resulted in an error: `Error: Failed to load custom CoverageProviderModule from undefined`.
- **Solution**: The issue was resolved by:
    1. Changing the coverage provider from `c8` to `v8` in `vitest.config.ts`.
    2. Installing the missing dependency `@vitest/coverage-v8`.

After these changes, the tests ran successfully with 100% coverage.

## 3. Final Project State

The project is now fully initialized and ready for development. It includes:

- A modern Node.js project setup with TypeScript.
- A robust testing framework with Vitest, with coverage enforcement.
- A CI pipeline to ensure code quality.
- Basic placeholder code and tests to guide future development.
- A well-defined project structure.
- Correctly configured `package.json` for publishing to npm.
